Exploratory Data Analysis on (Should This Loan be Approved or Denied?)

Context of the problem
The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a United States Government Agency formed in 1953 that provides support to entrepreneurs and small businesses. SBA acts much like an insurance provider to reduce the risk for a bank by taking on some of the risks by guaranteeing a portion of the loan. In the case that a loan goes into default, SBA then covers the amount they guaranteed. Since SBA loans only guarantee a portion of the entire loan balance, banks will incur some losses if a small business defaults on its SBA-guaranteed loan. Therefore, banks are still faced with a difficult choice as to whether they should grant such a loan because of the high risk of default.
